2. What are the coding standards you follow while you are writing python code?
A.PEP8(Python Enhancement Proposal)
3.Which python IDE you are using to develop python project and what other IDEs
are you familiar with?
A.1.IDLE (Integrated Development and Learning Environment)
  2.Pycharm
  3.Visual Studio Code
  4.Jupyter Notebook

4.What is the difference between list and tuple?
A.1.List and Tuple in Python are the classes of Python Data Structures.
  2.The list is dynamic, whereas the tuple has static characteristics.

  4.Lists are denoted by the square brackets but tuples are denoted as parenthesis.
5. What do you mean by mutable and Immutable objects?
6. What are the data types can we classify as mutable objects?
7. What are the data types can we classify as immutable objects?
A.mutable objects can change their state or contents and immutable objects can’t change their state or content.
 1.Mutable Objects : These are of type list, dict, set . Custom classes are generally mutable.
 2.Immutable Objects : These are of in-built types like int, float, bool, string, unicode, tuple. In simple words, an immutable object can’t be changed after it is created.
8.are numbers mutable or immutable objects?
A.Immutable Objects
9. How can python memory mapping be done?
A.Mmap module

1. Select all the correct options to join two lists in Python
    listOne  =  ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
    listTwo =  ['e', 'f', 'g']
 
 a)newList = listOne + listTwo)*
 b)newList = extend(listOne, listTwo)
 c)newList = listOne.extend(listTwo)*
 d)newList.extend(listOne, listTwo)

Explanation:

1.The extend() method adds all the elements of an iterable (list, tuple, string) to the end of the list.
2.You can also use the addition operator to join two list in Python



2. What is the output of the following code

      aList = ["PYnative", [4, 8, 12, 16]]
      print(aList[0][1])    
      print(aList[1][3])
a) P 8
   Y 16
b) P
   12
c) Y*
   16

3. What is the output of the following list operation

      sampleList = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
      print(sampleList[-2])
      print(sampleList[-4:-1])
  a) 40*
    [20, 30, 40]
  b)IndexError: list index out of range
Explanation:

Use the range of negative indexes to search from the end of the list.

4. What is the output of the following list operation
        aList = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80]
        print(aList[2:5])
        print(aList[:4])
        print(aList[3:])
 a)[20, 30, 40, 50]
   [10, 20, 30, 40]
   [30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80]
 b)[30, 40, 50]*
   [10, 20, 30, 40]
   [40, 50, 60, 70, 80]
Explanation:

Python list collection is ordered and changeable. The list also allows duplicate members. To get a sublist out of the list, we need to specify the range of indexes.  To get a sublist, we need to specify where to start and where to end the range.

Syntax: list[start:end] If start is missing it takes 0 as the starting index

5. What is the output of the following list function?
     sampleList = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
     sampleList.append(60)
     print(sampleList)
     sampleList.append(60)
     print(sampleList)
a) [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
   [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
b) [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]*
   [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 60]
Explanation:

The append() method is used to add an item at the end of a list. Also, the list allows duplicate items.
6. What is the output of the following code

     my_list = ["Hello", "Python"]
     print("-".join(my_list))
 a)HelloPython-
 b)Hello-Python*
 c)-HelloPython
Explanation:

The join() method will join all items in a list into a string, using a hyphen character as a separator.

7. In Python, list is mutable

  a) False
  b)True*

Explanation:

The list collection is ordered and changeable. A mutable object can be changed after it is created. So we can update or remove elements from a list once it is created.
8. What is the output of the following code

    list1 = ['xyz', 'zara', 'PYnative']
    print (max(list1))
 a) PYnative
 b)zara*

9. What is the output of the following

     aList = [5, 10, 15, 25]
     print(aList[::-2])
 a)[15, 10, 5]
 b)[10, 5]
 c)[25, 10]*
Explanation:

aList[::-2] Start from the end of the list with step value 2.
10. What is the output of the following list comprehension

     resList = [x+y for x in ['Hello ', 'Good '] for y in ['Dear', 'Bye']]
     print(resList)
 a)[‘Hello Dear’, ‘Hello Bye’, ‘Good Dear’, ‘Good Bye’]*
 b)[‘Hello Dear’, ‘Good Dear’, ‘Hello Bye’, ‘Good Bye’]

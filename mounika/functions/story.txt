Classic Fairy Tale Short Stories for Kids
“Cinderella” by Charles Perrault
“‘Do not cry, Cinderella,’ she said; ‘you also shall go to the ball, because you are a kind, good girl.'”
Why I love it: This is one of those short stories for kids that everyone probably already knows. This older version is a little different than the Disney movie, so ask kids if they can identify the changes. They can also have fun imagining what other items could be transformed to help Cinderella get to the ball!

“The Emperor’s New Clothes” by Hans Christian Andersen
"The Emperor's New Clothes" by Hans Christian Andersen.

“‘But the Emperor has nothing at all on!’ said a little child.”
Why I love it: This is a wonderful story for talking about peer pressure and being brave enough to stand up for what you believe in. Kids will also enjoy drawing the imaginary suit of clothes that the king thought he saw.

“The Frog Prince” by the Brothers Grimm
“And the princess, though very unwilling, took him up in her hand, and put him upon the pillow of her own bed, where he slept all night long. As soon as it was light, he jumped up, hopped downstairs, and went out of the house. ‘Now, then,’ thought the princess, ‘at last he is gone, and I shall be troubled with him no more.'”
